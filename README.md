# restic-systemd-units

A flexible systemd unit template for using Restic to backup your data to multiple repositories. It was designed to be lightweight and customizable with systemd overrides. If you want to have notifications on backup failures you will need to setup [Blazon](https://github.com/quickvm/blazon) (a simple systemd unit template for setting up `OnFailure=` notifications). See the Notifications section in this README for more info.

## Install the unit

**Note:** Make sure you have [restic](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/020_installation.html) installed!

Automatically:
1. Run `sudo mkdir /etc/restic`
1. Run `sudo ./install`

Manually:
1. Run `sudo mkdir /etc/restic`
1. `sudo cp mv units/* /etc/systemd/system/`
1. run `systemctl daemon-reload`


## Create backup configuration files

Below are examples for setting up Local, AWS, and Google Cloud backups. Be sure to create a `/etc/restic/exclude.conf` file and customize it to exclude files you do not want to backup. See the `examples/` directory for inspiration.

### Local

Create `/etc/restic/local.conf` and configure your local backups as you see fit. Since your configuration file might contain your `RESTIC_PASSWORD` or other sensitive information you will want to `chmod 0600 /etc/restic/local.conf` this file. Also make sure the path to `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` exits and your user has permissions to write to it.

```bash
RESTIC_BACKUP_EXCLUDES="--exclude-file /etc/restic/exclude.conf --exclude-if-present .restic_exclude"
RESTIC_BACKUP_PATHS="/home/bingo"
RESTIC_RETENTION_POLICY="--keep-within-hourly 24h --keep-within-daily 7d --keep-within-weekly 1m --keep-within-monthly 1y --keep-within-yearly 7y"
RESTIC_PASSWORD=mysupersecretbackuppassword
RESTIC_REPOSITORY=/mnt/storage/backups/bluey
```

### AWS

Setup an AWS S3 bucket with an IAM user and policy that has access to the bucket. See the [Restic AWS documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/080_examples.html) for more information. Then create `/etc/restic/aws.conf` and add the below configuration:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-2"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"
RESTIC_BACKUP_EXCLUDES="--exclude-file /etc/restic/exclude.conf --exclude-if-present .restic_exclude"
RESTIC_BACKUP_PATHS="/home/bingo"
RESTIC_PASSWORD="anothersuperscretpassword"
RESTIC_REPOSITORY="s3:https://s3.amazonaws.com/mycool-restic-backups-s3-bucket/bluey"
RESTIC_RETENTION_POLICY="--keep-within-hourly 24h --keep-within-daily 7d --keep-within-weekly 1m --keep-within-monthly 1y --keep-within-yearly 7y"
```

Since your `/etc/restic/aws.conf` configuration file might contain your `RESTIC_PASSWORD` or other sensitive information you will want to `chmod 0600 /etc/restic/aws.conf` this file.

### GCP

Create a [Google Cloud Storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) and then create a new Service Account that has access to that bucket. See the [Restic GCP documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#google-cloud-storage) for more information. Then create `/etc/restic/gcp.conf` and add the below configuration:

```bash
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=123123123123
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/etc/restic/gcs-secret-restic-key.json
RESTIC_BACKUP_EXCLUDES="--exclude-file /etc/restic/exclude.conf --exclude-if-present .restic_exclude"
RESTIC_BACKUP_PATHS="/home/bingo"
RESTIC_PASSWORD="themostsecretpasswordever"
RESTIC_REPOSITORY="gs:mycool-restic-backups-gcs-bucket:/bluey"
RESTIC_RETENTION_POLICY="--keep-within-hourly 24h --keep-within-daily 7d --keep-within-weekly 1m --keep-within-monthly 1y --keep-within-yearly 7y"
```

Since your `/etc/restic/gcp.conf` configuration file and your `/etc/restic/gs-secret-restic-key.json` Service Account JSON file might contain your `RESTIC_PASSWORD` or other sensitive information you will want to `chmod 0600 /etc/restic/aws.conf /etc/restic/gs-secret-restic-key.json` these two files.

## Initialize the repository

### Local

```
sudo ./bin/restic-wrapper /etc/restic/local.conf init
```

### AWS

```
sudo ./bin/restic-wrapper /etc/restic/aws.conf init
```

### GCP

```
sudo ./bin/restic-wrapper /etc/restic/gcp.conf init
```

## Enable and start the backup timers

### Local

```
sudo systemctl enable --now restic@local.timer
```

### AWS

```
sudo systemctl enable --now restic@aws.timer
```

### GCP

```
sudo systemctl enable --now restic@gcp.timer
```

## Interacting with your repositories

You can use `./bin/restic-wrapper /path/to/your.config` to run manual commands on your repositories. Be sure you have permissions to read the config file as your user.

**Run a check**

```bash
sudo ./bin/restic-wrapper /etc/restic/local.conf check
using temporary cache in /tmp/restic-check-cache-2107648289
repository 63c2e3d8 opened successfully, password is correct
created new cache in /tmp/restic-check-cache-2107648289
create exclusive lock for repository
load indexes
check all packs
check snapshots, trees and blobs
[0:08] 100.00%  14 / 14 snapshots
no errors were found
```

**Run a dry run forget**
```bash
sudo ./bin/restic-wrapper /etc/restic/local.conf forget --dry-run --verbose --tag local --group-by "paths,tags" --keep-within-hourly 24h --keep-within-daily 7d --keep-within-weekly 1m --keep-within-monthly 1y --keep-within-yearly 7y
repository 63c2e3d8 opened successfully, password is correct

## Enable backup failure notifications with Blazon ðŸ“£ðŸ“£

We will be setting up local desktop and Slack notifications in this example. You need to install the Blazon [systemd units](https://github.com/quickvm/blazon#install-the-systemd-unit-template) and you will need to create a Slack Incoming Webhook on your Slack org that posts messages to a channel. See the [repository](https://github.com/quickvm/blazon) for more information on using Blazon for configuring this systemd template unit.

**Configure Blazon for local and AWS backups**

Create systemd overrides for each `blazon@restic@` and service:

```
systemctl edit blazon@restic@local.service
systemctl edit blazon@restic@aws.service
```

and add the following to each:

```
[Service]
Environment=BLAZON_NOTIFY_DESKTOP=true
Environment=BLAZON_NOTIFY_SLACK=true
Environment=BLAZON_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAAAAAAAAAA/HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
```

Create overrides for each `restic@.service`:

```
systemctl edit restic@local.service
systemctl edit restic@aws.service
```

and add the following to each:

```
[Unit]
OnFailure=blazon@%N.service
```

Now you should get desktop notifications and a Slack message if any of your backups units fail!

## Ignore 3/NOTIMPLEMENTED exit codes

You may see failures on your backups like the one below. 

```

```

This is when the restic backup run exits with an exit code of `3/NOTIMPLEMENTED` when it scans your files at the start but one or more files are removed by the time it gets to them to back them up. You can ignore this exit code by adding:

```
[Service]
SuccessExitStatus=3
```

as a systemd override to your backup unit. This will still log the errors about the files not being able to be backed up, but it will not fail the systemd unit.
